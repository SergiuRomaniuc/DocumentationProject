# Documentation Project üìù

This is a simple Documentation Page project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You can scroll to the needed section, or you can click on it from
the navigation bar on the right. You can also see where you are
located on the page through the help of the highlighted section.
When you have found a code snippet that you like, you can copy it
using a special button in the top right corner.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/SergiuRomaniuc/DocumentationProject
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser or use *Live Server* in VS Code/WebStorm.

## Usage

Use the navigation bar on the left side of the page to
jump to different documentation sections. Each link
scrolls smoothly to the corresponding content area.<br/>
The page layout adapts to different screen sizes.
On smaller screens, the navigation bar may collapse
or shift to enhance readability.<br/>
As you scroll through the page, the currently visible
section is highlighted in the navigation bar, providing
context for where you are in the documentation.<br/>
Code examples are provided in &lt;pre>&lt;code> blocks.
Use the copy to clipboard button in the top-right
corner of each code block to quickly copy the code.<br/>
